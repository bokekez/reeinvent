Backend for Reeinvent words!

Project was made in node.js and express!

To run the project locally run these commands:

The backend will then be ready to accept requests, to test you can use the postman collection attached to this repository.
Import the collection to your postman app and send the saved requests.

To run unit tests you can run this command.
